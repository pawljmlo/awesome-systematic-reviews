# Awesome systematic reviews

A list of awesome information regarding evidence synthesis, systematic reviews, guidline development and decision-making.

The repository is devided in two parts. 
The first one is devoted to [general information](#general) and the following covers [automation and artificial intelligence](#automation-and-artificial-intelligence) in evidence synthesis and guidline development.

### Software

We plan to provide a searchable and sortable table containg software tools enabling evidence synthesis and guidline development along with information on licensing, source code availability, validation studies and metrics, phases of evidence synthesis and/or guidline development they can be applied to, etc.
The current version might be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UCSIMQlLHFMGEHCmbXefxxUva23q2ZUUZXokYNiaMXg/edit).
As for now, **we need your input**.
We invite volunteers and software developers who want to list their tools.
